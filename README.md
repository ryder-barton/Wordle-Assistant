# Wordle-Assistant
I made a program to assist you with your wordles!

WHAT THE CODE DOES:

When you run "wordle_assistant.py", it provides possible five-letter words based on your input. The words come from "wordle_list.py", which is a list of 2,293 five-letter words that could be used for wordle. I found this list on the internet at this link: https://www.foregolfleague.com/wordlelist.htm. It is possible that a wordle answer is not in this list, but this is an assistant not a guaranteed solver. Make sure you have both "wordle_assistant.py" and "wordle_list.py" downloaded for they need each other to run correctly. Once you run the program, follow the instructions and you should have a valid wordle assistant to help solve your wordles in as few guesses as possible.
